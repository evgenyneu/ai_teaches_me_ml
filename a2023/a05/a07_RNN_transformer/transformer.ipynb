    "Great job on completing the RNN exercise! For your next 60-minute session, I suggest you dive into learning about the Transformer architecture, which is a more advanced and efficient approach to handling language-related tasks. Here's a plan for a hands-on session:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Introduction to Transformers (5 minutes):\n",
    "    * Briefly discuss the limitations of RNNs (like difficulty in handling long-range dependencies) and the advantages of Transformers (like parallelization and self-attention mechanism).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Understanding Self-Attention Mechanism (10 minutes):\n",
    "    * Explain the concept of self-attention and how it helps in capturing long-range dependencies.\n",
    "    * Provide a simple example to illustrate the mechanism.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Implementing Multi-Head Attention (15 minutes):\n",
    "    * Write code to implement the multi-head attention mechanism using PyTorch in your Jupyter notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Creating the Transformer Architecture (20 minutes):\n",
    "    * Implement the Transformer architecture in your Jupyter notebook, including the encoder and decoder blocks, and the overall architecture.\n",
    "    * Set up the training process for a toy task, such as text classification or machine translation.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Training and Evaluating the Transformer Model (5 minutes):\n",
    "    * Train the Transformer model on the toy task and evaluate its performance.\n",
    "    * Compare the performance with the RNN model you built earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Discussing Further Improvements and Next Steps (5 minutes):\n",
    "    * Briefly discuss the possible improvements to the Transformer model, such as fine-tuning, using pre-trained models (e.g., BERT, GPT-2), and exploring more complex tasks.\n",
    "    * Outline potential next steps for further learning, such as learning about other advanced NLP techniques or diving into specific Transformer-based models like BERT or GPT-3.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember to add code cells and markdown explanations in your Jupyter notebook to guide you through each step. Enjoy your hands-on learning experience with Transformers!"
