Great! It's nice to see that you already have some experience with neural networks and PyTorch. For today's lesson, we'll work on building a simple language model using an RNN in PyTorch.

Here's the plan for our 60-minute session:

* Briefly discuss RNNs (5 min)
* Prepare the dataset (10 min)
* Implement a simple RNN model in PyTorch (15 min)
* Train the model (10 min)
* Test the model (10 min)
* Wrap up and discuss improvements (10 min)

Let's get started with a brief discussion of RNNs.

## 1. Briefly discuss RNNs (5 min)

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are a type of neural network designed to handle sequential data. They can maintain a hidden state that gets updated at each step in the sequence, making them well-suited for tasks like language modeling.

For our simple language model, we'll use a character-level RNN. It will predict the next character in a sequence given the previous characters. This is a simpler task compared to predicting the next word, as GPT models do.

## Next steps:

Please let me know if you are familiar with RNNs and if you have any questions about them. If you're ready to move on, I'll guide you through preparing the dataset for our language model.
